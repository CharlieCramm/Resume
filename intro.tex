\section{Introduct\textcolor{mycolor}{ion}}
\begin{center}
  I am a 24 year old guy from Belgium with some years of experience in the IT field.
  I've had exposure to areas like \textcolor{mycolor}{SSO/SAML, Linux, and Web development}. 
  While I value critical thinking and attention to detail, I am always open to learning and adapting to new scenarios. 
  I can work on my own, and I'm keen to improve and grow. 
  My communication abilities aid me in collaborating with teams, hoping to contribute in meaningful ways.
